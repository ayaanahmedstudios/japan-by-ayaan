            It for the alliteration, this Disneyland actually had an entire Toon Town area within it, which was a first from the only other Disneyland I visited in my life during a study exchange in Shanghai. Visiting the park was my first ever outing in Japan, I remember downloading a YouTube video telling me how to get to the Disney train station from Shinjuku Station where I was, which I eventually figured out, and stumbled into the theme park, which was completely crowded despite being a weekday. I put my patience behind me and waited multiple hours per rollercoaster.<br><br>After exiting space mountain, I found a secluded area with this, a perfect view of the Sleeping Beauty castle with a river in the foreground, I wasn't keen on taking my camera out inside the busy park, but I still took the time to take out my camera here and capture one of the only photographs I shot that day. I feel like this location and scene really capture a very nature-focused side of this park, in most Disney castle photos there tend to be hundreds of people around in front of it, but this feels different, with a river and trees, the people being one of the tiniest things in the shot, I couldn't think of a better angle.</p>
