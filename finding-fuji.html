    <div class="description"> <p> Mount Fuji, the 4th largest active volcano on Earth, and the highest peak in Japan. I travelled 2 hours from Tokyo to the lake town of Fujikawaguchiko, with the intention of photographing the picturesque views Google Images promised in the area, but surrounding mountains hid Fuji from most angles near the main town, and I couldn't figure out where to go since most tourists remained in the area near the lake with no view of Fuji.<br><br>Eventually, I found my way following a dirt path alone, with no people for kilometers, which led to me to my final view, I turned that find into a documentary for my high school media project, which is now known as Finding Fuji, which was later featured at my high school's Film Festival run by me, and later featured in the OCADU Booth at the Toronto Film Festival.<br><br>This photograph however, is of one of the instances I could see Fuji from within the town as well, I preferred showing this because it better emulates where I spent most of my time. My best view with a lake in the foreground and the colossal mountain in the background was the most cinematic, but this is how the residents would see everyday.
